* Continuous Normalizing Flows
  
  This repository provides a minimal implementation of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Continuous Normalizing Flows, as described in [fn:chen2018], for PyTorch using ODE solvers from SciPy.

* Installation

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install --user .
  #+END_SRC

  Optionally, run the tests to make sure that the installation is working:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install --user .[test]
    pytest -v
  #+END_SRC
